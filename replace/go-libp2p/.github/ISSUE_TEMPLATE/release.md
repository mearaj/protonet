## âœ… Release Checklist

- [ ] **Stage 0 - Finishing Touches**
    - [ ] Go through relevant libp2p repos looking for unreleased changes that should make it into the release. If you find any, cut releases.
    - [ ] Run `go get -u ./...` to see if there are any out-of-date deps that look important. If there are, bubble them. Try to avoid _directly_ updating indirect deps in go-libp2p's go.mod when possible.
    - [ ] Make sure local tests are passing.
- [ ] **Stage 1 - Upstream Testing**
  - Create testing branches in lotus & go-ipfs with the new go-libp2p release and run CI/tests. Many upstream projects are tested in CI, but lotus & go-ipfs are not.
    - [ ] [filecoin-project/lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus)
    - [ ] [ipfs/go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)
  - _(someday)_ Run upstream testground tests. Unfortunately, this is too time consuming at the moment.
    - _(someday)_ Run bitswap testground tests.
    - _(someday)_ Run DHT testground tests.
- [ ] **Stage 2 - Infrastructure Testing**
  - How: Using the testing branches created above, work with the infrastructure team to deploy the new libp2p versions to our infrastructure.
  - Where:
    - [ ] A go-ipfs gateway.
      - [ ] Deploy
      - [ ] Analyze
        - [ ] Look at pprof profile dumps, especially CPU profiles and heap allocation profiles, noting any significant changes.
    - [ ] A go-ipfs bootstrapper.
      - [ ] Deploy
      - [ ] Analyze
        - [ ] Look at pprof profile dumps, especially CPU profiles and heap allocation profiles, noting any significant changes.
        - [ ] Check peers (e.g., `ipfs swarm peers`) to make sure we're connecting to peers on all transports.
        - [ ] Check advertised addresses and protocols (e.g., `ipfs id`) to make sure they're sane.
- [ ] **Stage 3 - Release**
  - [ ] Tag the release on master.
  - [ ] Publish the release through the GitHub UI, adding the release notes. Some users rely on this to receive notifications of new releases.
  - [ ] Announce the release on the [discuss.libp2p.io](https://discuss.libp2p.io).
- [ ] **Stage 4 - Update Upstream**
  - [ ] Update the upstream testing branches to the final release and create PRs.
