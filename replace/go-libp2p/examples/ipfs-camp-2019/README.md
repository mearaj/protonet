# IPFS Camp 2019 - Course B
We've included some scaffolding to help you through the workshop. The folders
in this repository are "checkpoints" of the project as we progress through the
project goals. Should you get stuck at one and find yourself eager to push on,
feel free to save your work and move on to the next stage!

## Dependencies
- [golang 1.12+](https://golang.org)

## Optional Tooling
If you'd like a more pleasant editing experience, VS Code's golang plugin has
fantastic support for the nascent go language server implementation. I
recommend saibing's fork which adds lots of useful features.

- [saibing's go language server](https://github.com/saibing/tools)
  Specifically tools/cmd/gopls
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Running the Examples
All of the examples, 01-Transports through 08-End, will compile as written. To
execute, simply change into the respective example's directory and run
`go run .`
